"Way too many giggles coming from the peanut gallery!! They must have been eating way too much cake during morning and afternoon tea. My head is spinning trying to keep track of all this new information, but I can see it being very useful once I get my head around it!",Library,156,Macquarie University,Josephine,Female
The LATN Library Data Carpentry Workshop at UTS Library has been a phenomenally life-altering experience. Food was yum. Temp is good. Space works well. Soooo well organised. Thank you organising LATN people. Thank you UTS Library. Thank you umpires. Thank you ball people. Please do not tell anyone my brain hurts.,Information Science,153,Macquarie University,Jo Hardy,Non-specific
"The workshop has stressed my boundaries of understanding of programming but through peer support the training has been beneficial. I will not be able to use all the content in my daily work but I will now be able to provide better guidance to the researchers at my institution. I have struggled with technical issues which has hindered my learning. As well, copying code from the screens has been extremely difficult due to the size of the font and my poor eyesight",Library,156,University of New England,Leonie Sherwin,Female
"The workshop has been interesting and challenging, which is a good thing. There have been some technical issues but thankfully Mac has escaped relatively unscathed. The groupwork has helped to sort out which bits have stuck, and the food has been fabulous. Googling munging was definitely an eye opener!",Library,180,University of Wollongong,Jen Lyons,Female
"Thank you to the organisers, participants and tutors. This course has been an eye opener and I am wrangling how to imaginge this as a library offering in the real world. When I get back to work I will start a new series of conversations to see how much benefit can be created.",Research data management,178cm,Monash University Library,Neil Dickson,M
"This workshop is a good introduction and it's good to work hands on, but I would have liked to have more background or overview of the subject area as I am completely new to all of this. Now I'm adding a few more characters in here so it will go over the limit",Psychology,155,AUT,Jessica,Female
